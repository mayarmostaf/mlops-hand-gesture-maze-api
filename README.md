# MLOps Course Labs

Welcome to the lab repository for the [MLOps Course](https://github.com/Heba-Atef99/MLOps-Course).

Throughout this hands-on journey, you'll develop a **Bank Customer Churn Prediction** applicationâ€”starting from the research phase and progressing through the full MLOps lifecycle, all the way to deployment.

> **Note:** Currently, the repository contains only the `research` branch. The remaining branches will be built step by step by the reader during the course days, as part of the learning experience.
